## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/) - Bootstrap framework
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For Fonts
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### What I learned

Saving time writing CSS using Bootstrap framework and Grid System :

```html
<div class="container border-0 g-0 price pb-1">
	<div class="row g-0">
		<div class="col-6 col-sm-8 border-0-0 pricemain text-success">$149.99</div>
		<div class="col-6 col-sm-4 border-0-0 pricecross ">$169.99</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

How to swap pictures using Media Query for Responsive web design :		

```html
<div class="col-sm-6 border-0" id="ProductImage">
  <img src="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-3 image1" alt="">
  <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-3 image2" alt="">
</div>
```
```css
.image2 {
    display: none;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 576px) {

    .image1 {
        display: none !important;
    }

    .image2 {
        display: block;
        border-bottom-left-radius: 0% !important;
        border-bottom-right-radius: 0% !important;
    }
```
I completed this challenge faster than my first one, thanks to the Bootstrap framework.

### Continued development

after a few weeks of learning html, css, and bootstrap. my next focus is to learn Javascript. wish me luck.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52941346/css-height-calc100vh-vs-height-100vh) - This helped me for a lot of things such as understanding some properties i don't know about. because there's a lot of people with similar problem and people who solved the problem with example. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - This is an amazing website which i can find courses to learn everything about tech. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning web development.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap Framework. it is a collection of pre-written code chunks in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that allows developers to create websites more quickly than if they had to create every bit of code from scratch. It saves developers time so that they can focus on other things rather than coding CSS.
